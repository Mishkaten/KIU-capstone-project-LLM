    Try to guess the hidden word one letter at a   
    time. The number of dashes are equivalent to   
    the number of letters in the word. If a player 
    suggests a letter that occurs in the word,     
    blank places containing this character will be 
    filled with that letter. If the word does not  
    contain the suggested letter, one new element  
    of a hangmanâ€™s gallow is painted. As the game  
    progresses, a segment of a victim is added for 
    every suggested letter not in the word. Goal is
    to guess the word before the man hangs!
