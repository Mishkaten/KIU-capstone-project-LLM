Exercise 3: File Handling and Data Processing

Problem Description:
Write a Python function `process_log_file(file_path)` that reads a log file, processes the data, and returns a dictionary with statistics. The log file contains multiple lines, each representing a log entry with the format:
timestamp, log_level, message
- timestamp: A string representing the date and time of the log entry (e.g., "2024-06-02 14:22:10")
- log_level: A string representing the log level (e.g., "INFO", "ERROR", "WARNING")
- message: A string representing the log message

The function should:
1. Read the log file.
2. Count the number of log entries for each log level.
3. Identify the earliest and latest timestamp in the log file.
4. Return a dictionary with the following structure:
{
    "log_counts": {"INFO": x, "ERROR": y, "WARNING": z},
    "earliest_timestamp": "timestamp",
    "latest_timestamp": "timestamp"
}

Function Signature:
def process_log_file(file_path: str) -> dict:
    pass

Example:
Assume the content of `log.txt` is:
2024-06-02 14:22:10, INFO, System started
2024-06-02 14:23:15, ERROR, An error occurred
2024-06-02 14:24:20, WARNING, Low disk space
2024-06-02 14:25:25, INFO, User logged in
Calling `process_log_file("log.txt")` should return:
{
    "log_counts": {"INFO": 2, "ERROR": 1, "WARNING": 1},
    "earliest_timestamp": "2024-06-02 14:22:10",
    "latest_timestamp": "2024-06-02 14:25:25"
}

Grading Scheme:
- File Reading (2 points):
  - Correctly reads the log file.
- Log Level Counting (3 points):
  - Accurately counts the number of log entries for each log level.
- Timestamp Identification (3 points):
  - Correctly identifies the earliest and latest timestamps in the log file.
- Return the Result (1 point):
  - Returns the dictionary with the correct structure and data.
- Code Readability and Comments (1 point):
  - Code is well-structured and includes appropriate comments explaining each step.

Total: 10 points
