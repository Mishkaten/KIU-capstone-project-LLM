Mystic Creatures of the Wild

Draw a (simple) model of beast inheritance (in UML). This should provide genera of (mystic) creatures with the following abilites/activities:

NameabilityPenguin   eatPigeoneat, flyDragoneat, fly, breathFireMonstereat, breathFire

Common abilities of several genera should in the model be represented by common super- classes or interfaces and specified there with appropriate methods.

Implement the classes of your model, first without default methods. Name all classes by using the prefix Simple (e.g., SimplePenguin).

The methods should only produce text outout (e.g., Penguin eats., Dragon flies.).

Now realize the classes by means of default methods. For that, add a method String getClassName() to all classes/interfaces where it might be useful.

Please note that the tests we provided expect our envisioned solution. If you have chosen another meaningful organization of classes/interfaces, your solution may nonetheless be correct - even if this is not approved by our tests.
