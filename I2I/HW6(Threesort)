Threesort

The following MiniJava program realizes the algorithm "Threesort", wellknown to all penguins of honor. Here, we consider the instance for the fixed numbers 12, 5 and 1.

1  |  int a, b, c;
2  |  int temp;
3  |  a = 12;
4  |  b = 5;
5  |  c = 1;
6  |  while (a > b || b > c) {
7  |      if (a > b) {
8  |          temp = a;
9  |          a = b;
10 |          b = temp;
11 |      } else {
12 |          temp = b;
13 |          b = c;
14 |          c = temp;
15 |      }
16 |  }
17 |  write(a);
18 |  write(b);
19 |  write(c);


to the left of the character  |_ are the line numbers of the code, to the right, the corresponding program text._

1. Control-flow Diagramm

Draw the control-flow diagram according to the rules of the lecture and the solution of the FoP exercise w3cf. Different colors are not required. Take care that all elements of the control-flow diagram are clearly recognizable. In particular, this refers the form of the boxes occurring in your diagram as well as the arrows between these.

2. Table of Program States

Create a table for the values of variables attained after executing the corresponding line of code. Again, you may follow here the conventions use in the corresponding FoP exercise w3cf. List only those lines which contain assignments (name = expr; of the MiniJava grammar). To the left, put the line number; for variables having not yet received a value, you may record a minus/hyphen.

Accordingly, your table should look as follows:

Line numberrabctemp...............

Has in the end, Threesort successfully sorted the given numbers a, b and c so that ùëé‚â§ùëè‚â§ùëêa‚â§b‚â§c holds? Please record below your table whether this is the case, e.g., by stating "a, b and c have been sorted" or "a, b and c have not been sorted".

Hint: Make sure that your representation is easily readable and clear. In drawings, calculate roughly in advance how much space is needed for which part of the assignment. You may hand in your solution as PDF, PNG or JPG. Make also sure that your solution is correctly oriented. Otherwise, you may suffer deduction of points.
