Pingu and the Fish
In this assignment, pingu should be helped on its search for fish. Pingu lives in a world of rectangular shape which is sub-divided into tiles or fields. Each individual field may represent different terrains where the field occupied by pingu before a move determines how she may proceed during the move. Pingu starts at a particular field and may perform arbitrarily many moves. It is (among others) your task, for a given world and a given initial position of Pingu, to determine whether Pingu may reach a field containing a fish.

A world is represented by a 2-dim. array of int values. Each field of this world belongs to the particular terrain indicated by the int-value of the corresponding entry of the array. The following values may occur:

0: Land: on land, Pingu is slow. Pingy may proceed in each direction (i.e., left, right, up or down) only by a single field.
1: Ice: ice is slippery! Pingu may only proceed along one of the diagonals by a single field.
2: Water: from this field, Pingu may proceed in any of the diagonals exactly three fields. The two fields in-between are jumped over.
3: Shark: Danger! Pingu must not stay on a field with a shark and thus also not perform a move ending on such a field.
4: Fish: This is the place of Pingu's strongest desire!
Moves which lead out of the world (obviously) are not permitted.

Implementation
Implement the following functions. Thereby, do not change the method heads.

 Output of the World 2 of 2 tests passing
Implement the method public static void printWorld(int[][] world, int pinguRow, int pinguColumn), which prints the world to the console. The first dimension indexes the rows, while the second refers to the columns of the world. When outputting the world, take care that

A field with Land should be represented as an 'L'.
A field with Ice is represented as an 'I'.
A field with Water is represented as an 'W'.
A field with a shark is represented as an 'S'.
A field with Fish is represented as an 'F'.
Pingu is located at the field in row pinguRow an column pinguColumn. This location is indicated by putting "(P)" behind the terrain. The range of values of pinguRow and pinguColumn thereby starts with 0.
The individual columns are separated by a tab ('\t'). In front of the first and behind the last column there is no tab.
Examples:
Example 1: Expected output of printWorld(world, 0, 0), when world is the world generated by generateExampleWorldOne().

W(P)    S       S       S       S       S
S       L       S       S       F       S
S       S       S       S       S       I
S       S       S       L       I       S
S       S       S       S       S       S
Example 2: Expected output of printWorld(world, 0, 1), when world is the world generated by generateExampleWorldTwo().

L       L(P)    L       W
L       L       L       I
L       I       S       F
S       F       S       S
 Can Pingu Reach a Fish? 1 of 2 tests passing
Realize a method public static boolean isFishReachable(int[][] world, int pinguRow, int pinguColumn). Your method is meant to determine whether Pingu, when starting at location pinguRow, pinguColumn, may reach along arbitrarily many moves a field with Fish. If Pingu starts at a field with Shark, she obviously will be eaten herself, and thus cannot reach Fish anymore. In this case, your method therefore should return false.

Solve this problem by means of recursion. Thereby, you may very well define and call a recursive auxiliary method. Take care that you do not let Pingu run in circles (leading to non-termination).

 ### Examples:
-    Example 1: For the call `isFishReachable(world, 0, 0)`, return value `true` is   expected, when `world` is th world provided by `generateExampleWorldOne()`.
-    Example 2: For the call `isFishReachable(world, 0, 0)`, return value `false` is  expected, when `world` is th world provided by `generateExampleWorldTwo()`.
Hints:
You may define arbitrarily many auxiliary methods.
As imports, only packages are permitted from java.lang.*.
The values in the array are always in the range from 0 to 4 (both values inclusive).
Your implementation will be tested with arrays containing up to 3000 fields and therefore should be able to survive that.
