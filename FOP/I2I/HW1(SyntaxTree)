Problem statement:

Syntax-tree

Draw a syntax-tree for the following MiniJava program according to the MiniJava grammar from the lecture.

int x,r;
int n;
r = 1;
n = 1;
x = readInt();
while (n < x) {
    if (r % 1 == 0)
        r = r * n;
    else {
        r = r * (-n);
    }
    n = n + 1;
    write (r);
}
