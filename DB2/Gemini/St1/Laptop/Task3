Understanding Denormalization in MongoDB
MongoDB, as a NoSQL database, prioritizes flexibility and performance over strict normalization. Denormalization is common, meaning data that would be separated into multiple tables in a relational database is often nested within a single document in MongoDB.
Example Teacher Document
Let's assume we have a teacher document in a MongoDB collection:
JSON
{
    "_id": ObjectId("6486631fa078f41286b398c6"),
    "name": "John Doe",
    "subjects": ["Math", "Physics"],
    "classes": [
        {
            "name": "Algebra 101",
            "students": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
        },
        {
            "name": "Physics Fundamentals",
            "students": ["David", "Emma", "Frank"]
        }
    ]
}
Use code with caution.

Normalization Concepts Violated
	1	Atomicity (1NF): The subjects array violates 1NF. Ideally, each subject should be a separate record in a "subjects" table.
	2	Second Normal Form (2NF): The nested classes array, especially the students within it, violates 2NF. Student data should be in a separate "students" table, with a foreign key relationship to the "classes" table.
Retrieving Insertion Time
MongoDB automatically adds a _id field to each document upon insertion. This _id is an ObjectId object that contains a timestamp component. We can extract the timestamp to get the insertion time.
Solution (JavaScript Example with MongoDB Node.js Driver)
JavaScript
const { MongoClient, ObjectId } = require('mongodb');

async function main() {
    const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017');
    await client.connect();
    const db = client.db('school'); // Assuming 'school' is your database

    const teacherCollection = db.collection('teachers');

    const teacher = await teacherCollection.findOne();
    if (teacher) {
        const insertionTime = new Date(teacher._id.getTimestamp());

        console.log("Teacher Document:");
        console.log(teacher);

        console.log("\nInsertion Time:");
        console.log(insertionTime);
    }

    await client.close();
}

main();
Use code with caution.

Explanation:
	1	Connect: Connect to your MongoDB database.
	2	Query: Fetch a single teacher document using findOne().
	3	Get Timestamp: Extract the timestamp from the _id's ObjectId.
	4	Display: Print the teacher document and its insertion time.
Key Points
	•	MongoDB's flexibility allows for denormalization, which can improve read performance.
	•	Denormalization can introduce data redundancy and potential update anomalies.
	•	The _id field provides a convenient way to track document insertion time.
