Initial State:

Table test is created but initially empty.

First Command:
    INSERT INTO public.test (name) VALUES ('Alice');
    After execution, table contains:
    ID | name
    ----|------
    1  | Alice

Second Command:
    INSERT INTO public.test (name) VALUES ('Bob');
    After execution, table contains:

    ID | name
    ----|------
    1  | Alice
    2  | Bob

Third Command:
    UPDATE public.test SET name = 'Charlie' WHERE name = 'Alice';
    After execution, table contains:

    ID | name
    ----|------
    1  | Charlie
    2  | Bob

Fourth Command:
    DELETE FROM public.test WHERE name = 'Bob';
    After execution, table contains:
    ID | name
    ----|------
    1  | Charlie

Fifth Command:

    INSERT INTO public.test (name) VALUES ('Eve');
    After execution, table contains:
    ID | name
    ----|------
    1  | Charlie
    3  | Eve

Final State:
    After running these commands with autocommit on, the final state of the table test will be:

    ID | name
    ----|------
    1 | Charlie
    3 | Eve



2)
Given Commands:

INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (1, 'Miller');
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (2, 'Neuer');
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (3, 'Doe');
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (4, 'Smith');
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (4, 'Summer');
COMMIT;

Analysis:

Initial State:

    Table test is empty.

First Command (Autocommit Mode):

    INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (1, 'Miller');
    This row is inserted and committed immediately.
    Table after command:

    ID | name
    ----|-------
    1  | Miller

Second Command (Autocommit Mode):

    INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (2, 'Neuer');
    This row is inserted and committed immediately.
    Table after command:
    
    ID | name
    ----|-------
    1  | Miller
    2  | Neuer


Begin Transaction:

    BEGIN;
    No change to the table yet, but subsequent commands are now part of a transaction and will not be committed until a COMMIT statement is issued.

Third Command (Transaction Mode):

    INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (3, 'Doe');
    This row is inserted but not yet committed.
    Table state (uncommitted):

    ID | name
    ----|-------
    1  | Miller
    2  | Neuer
    3  | Doe


Fourth Command (Transaction Mode):

    INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (4, 'Smith');
    This row is inserted but not yet committed.
    Table state (uncommitted):

    ID | name
    ----|-------
    1  | Miller
    2  | Neuer
    3  | Doe
    4  | Smith

Fifth Command (Transaction Mode):

    INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (4, 'Summer');
    This command tries to insert a row with a duplicate ID (4).
    This violates the primary key constraint, causing the entire transaction to fail.
    Since autocommit is off, and this command is within an uncommitted transaction, the entire transaction is rolled back.
    No rows from the transaction block (commands 3, 4, and 5) are inserted into the table.

Commit Transaction:

    COMMIT;
    Since the transaction failed due to the primary key violation, the commit does not apply any changes from the transaction block.

Final State:
    The final state of the table test after all commands have been run with autocommit off is:
    ID | name
    ----|-------
    1 | Miller
    2 | Neuer

Explanation:
    The commands before the BEGIN statement were executed with autocommit on, so they were committed immediately.
    The commands within the transaction block were rolled back due to a primary key violation (ID 4 already exists).
    As a result, only the rows inserted before the transaction (Miller and Neuer) are in the table.
