Extending the Database for Lesson Locations
To extend the database to manage lesson locations with buildings and rooms, and to implement the condition that at a specific lesson time, a room in a building can only be assigned to one lesson (timeslot/teacher/student combination), we will follow these steps:

Create new tables for buildings and rooms.
Extend the existing lessons table to include references to these new tables.
Add foreign keys to ensure referential integrity.
Implement a unique constraint to ensure that a room can only be assigned to one lesson at a specific time.



SQL Script
Here's the SQL script to create and alter the necessary tables and constraints:
-- Create Buildings table
CREATE TABLE buildings (
    building_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    building_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

-- Create Rooms table
CREATE TABLE rooms (
    room_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    room_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    building_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (building_id) REFERENCES buildings(building_id)
);

-- Assume there is already a Lessons table, now we alter it
-- Add foreign keys to link to buildings and rooms
ALTER TABLE lessons
ADD COLUMN building_id INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN room_id INTEGER,
ADD FOREIGN KEY (building_id) REFERENCES buildings(building_id),
ADD FOREIGN KEY (room_id) REFERENCES rooms(room_id);

-- Add a unique constraint to ensure that at a specific lesson time,
-- a room in a building can only be assigned to one lesson (timeslot/teacher/student combination)
ALTER TABLE lessons
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_lesson_assignment UNIQUE (timeslot, building_id, room_id);





Explanation
Buildings Table: Stores information about buildings.

building_id: Primary key.
building_name: Name of the building.
Rooms Table: Stores information about rooms within buildings.

room_id: Primary key.
room_number: Room number or name.
building_id: Foreign key referencing buildings.
Lessons Table Alterations: Assumes the existence of a lessons table. The table is extended with:

building_id: Foreign key referencing buildings.
room_id: Foreign key referencing rooms.
unique_lesson_assignment: Ensures that a specific combination of timeslot, building_id, and room_id is unique, thus enforcing the requirement that a room can only be assigned to one lesson at a specific time.
