3.1

The Solution for 3.1 According to the Text
Explanation: When a new transaction 
n
+
1
n+1 requests a shared lock (S-lock) on an object, it will only be involved in the waits-for-graph if another transaction already holds an exclusive lock (X-lock) on that object. Since only one transaction can hold an X-lock on any object at any time, the new transaction will wait for that single transaction.

Number of new edges added to the waits-for-graph:
The new transaction will wait for exactly one transaction holding the X-lock, adding 1 new edge to the waits-for-graph.

Therefore, the solution for 3.1 is that the maximum number of new edges that will be added to the waits-for-graph when a new transaction (
n
+
1
n+1) requests an S-lock is 1.

Summary
3.1: The new transaction (
n
+
1
n+1) requesting a S-lock will add 1 new edge to the waits-for-graph.
3.2: The new transaction requesting an X-lock will add n new edges to the waits-for-graph.
