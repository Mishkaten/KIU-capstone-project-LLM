When autocommit is on, every SQL command is automatically committed to the database as soon as it is executed. Here’s the detailed step-by-step explanation:

INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (1, 'Miller');

This command successfully inserts a row with ID 1 and name 'Miller' and is immediately committed to the database.
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (2, 'Neuer');

This command successfully inserts a row with ID 2 and name 'Neuer' and is immediately committed to the database.
Begin;

This command starts a new transaction. Changes made after this point are part of this transaction and are not committed until the Commit command is issued.
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (3, 'Doe');

This command inserts a row with ID 3 and name 'Doe'. Since autocommit is on, this change is part of the current transaction and not yet committed.
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (4, 'Smith');

This command inserts a row with ID 4 and name 'Smith'. It is also part of the current transaction and not yet committed.
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (4, 'Summer');

This command tries to insert another row with ID 4 and name 'Summer'. However, it fails because ID 4 already exists, violating the primary key constraint. Due to this failure, the entire transaction is rolled back, and none of the changes made within this transaction are committed.
Commit;

Since the previous insert failed, the transaction is rolled back, and Commit does not apply any changes from this transaction.
Thus, the rows in the table after all commands with autocommit on are:
ID | Name
---------
1  | Miller
2  | Neuer
Explanation for Question 2: Rows in the table with autocommit off
When autocommit is off, commands are not committed automatically and must be explicitly committed. Here’s the detailed step-by-step explanation:

INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (1, 'Miller');

This command successfully inserts a row with ID 1 and name 'Miller' and must be explicitly committed, but since autocommit is off, it waits for an explicit Commit command.
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (2, 'Neuer');

This command successfully inserts a row with ID 2 and name 'Neuer'. Again, it waits for an explicit Commit command.
Begin;

This command starts a new transaction. Changes made after this point are part of this transaction and are not committed until the Commit command is issued.
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (3, 'Doe');

This command inserts a row with ID 3 and name 'Doe'. It is part of the current transaction and not yet committed.
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (4, 'Smith');

This command inserts a row with ID 4 and name 'Smith'. It is also part of the current transaction and not yet committed.
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (4, 'Summer');

This command tries to insert another row with ID 4 and name 'Summer'. However, it fails because ID 4 already exists, violating the primary key constraint. Due to this failure, the entire transaction is rolled back, and none of the changes made within this transaction are committed.
Commit;

Since the previous insert failed, the transaction is rolled back, and Commit does not apply any changes from this transaction.
ID | Name
---------
1  | Miller
2  | Neuer
When autocommit is off, every command runs in a transaction that must be explicitly committed. Here’s the correct detailed step-by-step explanation:

Initial State:

The table is empty before running any commands.
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (1, 'Miller');

This command starts a transaction and successfully inserts a row with ID 1 and name 'Miller'.
Pending transaction:
markdown
Copy code
ID | Name
-----------
1  | Miller
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (2, 'Neuer');

This command successfully inserts a row with ID 2 and name 'Neuer'.
Pending transaction:
markdown
Copy code
ID | Name
-----------
1  | Miller
2  | Neuer
Begin;

This command tries to start a new transaction but will issue a warning because a transaction is already running.
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (3, 'Doe');

This command inserts a row with ID 3 and name 'Doe'. It is part of the current transaction.
Pending transaction:
markdown
Copy code
ID | Name
-----------
1  | Miller
2  | Neuer
3  | Doe
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (4, 'Smith');

This command inserts a row with ID 4 and name 'Smith'. It is also part of the current transaction.
Pending transaction:
markdown
Copy code
ID | Name
-----------
1  | Miller
2  | Neuer
3  | Doe
4  | Smith
INSERT INTO public.test("ID", name) VALUES (4, 'Summer');

This command tries to insert another row with ID 4 and name 'Summer'. However, it fails because ID 4 already exists, violating the primary key constraint. Due to this failure, the entire transaction is rolled back, and none of the changes made within this transaction are committed.
Pending transaction after rollback:
markdown
Copy code
ID | Name
-----------
Commit;

The previous INSERT failed, causing the transaction to be rolled back. Therefore, the Commit command does not apply any changes from the failed transaction.
Result with autocommit off:

markdown
Copy code
ID | Name
---------
Summary
In the scenario with autocommit off, the rows in the table after executing all the commands are:

markdown
Copy code
ID | Name
---------
The reason is that the initial INSERT commands started a transaction. The subsequent INSERT commands were part of this transaction. When the duplicate ID insertion failed, it caused the entire transaction to roll back, leaving the table empty.

In contrast, with autocommit on, only the successful INSERT commands are committed immediately. Thus, the rows in the table are:

markdown
Copy code
ID | Name
---------
1  | Miller
2  | Neuer
