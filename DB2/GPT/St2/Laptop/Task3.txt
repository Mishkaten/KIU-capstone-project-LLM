Example Document from Teacher Collection
Let's assume we have a document in the teacher collection as follows:

{
    "_id": ObjectId("60a7b9f1f9e5a2c48c8b4567"),
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "subjects": ["Math", "Physics"],
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Springfield",
        "state": "IL",
        "zip": "62704"
    },
    "lessons": [
        {
            "lesson_id": ObjectId("60a7c9f1f9e5a2c48c8b4568"),
            "lesson_time": "2024-06-04T10:00:00Z",
            "student_id": ObjectId("60a7d9f1f9e5a2c48c8b4569"),
            "subject": "Math"
        },
        {
            "lesson_id": ObjectId("60a7e9f1f9e5a2c48c8b456a"),
            "lesson_time": "2024-06-04T12:00:00Z",
            "student_id": ObjectId("60a7f9f1f9e5a2c48c8b456b"),
            "subject": "Physics"
        }
    ],
    "insertion_time": ISODate("2024-06-01T12:00:00Z")
}


Normalization Concepts Violated
Redundancy:

The lessons array stores information about lessons directly within the teacher document. If multiple teachers teach the same lesson, this data is duplicated across multiple documents.
Violates the concept of First Normal Form (1NF) which requires that all fields contain only atomic values and that each record needs to be unique.
Partial Dependencies:

Fields within the lessons array, such as student_id, lesson_time, and subject, are dependent on lesson_id and not directly on the teacher document.
Violates Second Normal Form (2NF) as there are partial dependencies within the nested arrays, where some attributes depend only on a part of the primary key of the embedded documents.
Transitive Dependencies:

The address object has fields that are dependent on address and not directly on the teacher document.
Violates Third Normal Form (3NF) as there are transitive dependencies, meaning non-key attributes depend on other non-key attributes.


Retrieving the Insertion Time of the Document
To retrieve the insertion time of the document, we can query the MongoDB collection and extract the relevant field

// Assuming the use of MongoDB shell or a JavaScript environment for MongoDB

// Retrieve the document by its _id
db.teacher.find(
    { "_id": ObjectId("60a7b9f1f9e5a2c48c8b4567") },
    { "insertion_time": 1, "_id": 0 }
).pretty();


This query will output the insertion time of the document:

{
    "insertion_time": ISODate("2024-06-01T12:00:00Z")
}


Solution Summary
Document with Violations:

{
    "_id": ObjectId("60a7b9f1f9e5a2c48c8b4567"),
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "subjects": ["Math", "Physics"],
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Springfield",
        "state": "IL",
        "zip": "62704"
    },
    "lessons": [
        {
            "lesson_id": ObjectId("60a7c9f1f9e5a2c48c8b4568"),
            "lesson_time": "2024-06-04T10:00:00Z",
            "student_id": ObjectId("60a7d9f1f9e5a2c48c8b4569"),
            "subject": "Math"
        },
        {
            "lesson_id": ObjectId("60a7e9f1f9e5a2c48c8b456a"),
            "lesson_time": "2024-06-04T12:00:00Z",
            "student_id": ObjectId("60a7f9f1f9e5a2c48c8b456b"),
            "subject": "Physics"
        }
    ],
    "insertion_time": ISODate("2024-06-01T12:00:00Z")
}


Insertion Time:
{
    "insertion_time": ISODate("2024-06-01T12:00:00Z")
}


This solution explains the normalization concepts violated by the document, retrieves the insertion time, and includes the document and insertion time in the solution.
